* Objective
  - To view the Simulationof “Deflection in Beam ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/strength-of-materials-nitk/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Deflection in Beam/Deflection in Beam_01_Usability_smk.org][Deflection in Beam_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Now Vary the load value

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. The Length of the beam,mobulus of elasticity,second moment of inertia and defection values should also vary as load varies and it should be displayed on the screen.

* Review/comments
