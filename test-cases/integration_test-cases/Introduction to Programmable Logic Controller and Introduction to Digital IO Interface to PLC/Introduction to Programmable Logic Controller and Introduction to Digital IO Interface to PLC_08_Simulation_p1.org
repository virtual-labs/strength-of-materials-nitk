* Objective
  - To view the Simulation of the Introduction to Programmable Logic Controller and Introduction to Digital I/O Interface to PLC experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/industrial-electrical-drives-nitk/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Introduction to Programmable Logic Controller and Introduction to Digital IO Interface to PLC/Introduction to Programmable Logic Controller and Introduction to Digital IO Interface to PLC_01_Usability_smk.org][Introduction to Programmable Logic Controller and Introduction to Digital IO Interface to PLC_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on the Play button
  4. Click on the Pause button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. When we click on the Play button the simulation Presentation should start playing and when we click on the Pause button the simulation Presentation should stop playing the Presentation
